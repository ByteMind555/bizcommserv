# 🚀 bizcommserv: Elevating Your Communication Experience! 🌐💬

Welcome aboard Air New Zealand's groundbreaking Technology Platform eXperience (TPX)! Our bizcommserv is your passport to seamless communication, boasting RESTful services for eMail, SMS, and Chats (soon, for both user to user & user to group). 🚀✉️🤝

## Assumptions
1. Forget databases and mailboxes! For our MVP, we're wowing you with in-memory volatile Java collections. It's a demo that's as dynamic as it gets!
2. We're bringing three show-stopping functionalities to the stage:
   1. **Send Message**
   2. **Next-Level Get Message with Search Magic**
   3. **Save as Draft**

## Design Considerations
1. We're thinking big with a 'Contract First' API Design approach.
2. Dive into the swagger specification at [GitHub Swagger Spec](https://github.com/ByteMind555/bizcommserv/blob/main/communicationserv/src/main/resources/schema/swagger.json).
3. Copy the swagger.json content, paste it in [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/), and witness the magic unfold.
4. From swagger.json, have conjured up the Java spec file powering the entire show.
